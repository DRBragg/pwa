# Progressive Web Apps for Rails

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/pwa.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/pwa) <img src="https://travis-ci.org/jonhue/pwa.svg?branch=master" />

This gem only provides the foundation you can build your Progressive Web App upon. It simplifies adding a service worker and a manifest to your app, so it can be recognized as an PWA and be accessed without a network connection.

[Google](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) defines Progressive Web Apps as:

* **Reliable** - Load instantly and never show the downasaur, even in uncertain network conditions.
    * This is handled by Progressive Web Apps for Rails.
* **Fast** - Respond quickly to user interactions with silky smooth animations and no janky scrolling.
    * There are two technologies helping you with performance: *Turbolinks* & *AMP*. When you are using Turbolinks, use [TurbolinksAnimate](https://github.com/jonhue/turbolinks-animate) to get XHR requests + smooth page transitions that add some delight to using to your app. If you want to use AMP, take a look at [amp-html](https://github.com/jonhue/amp-html), an Accelerated Mobile Pages library for Rails apps.
* **Engaging** - Feel like a natural app on the device, with an immersive user experience.
    * When you think about making your app more engaging, you can't get around user-notifications. OneSignal is a powerful (& free) solution. With [devise-onseignal](https://github.com/jonhue/devise-onesignal) and [notification-pusher-onesignal](https://github.com/jonhue/notifications-rails/tree/master/notification-pusher/notification-pusher-onesignal) adding native notification capabilities to your app becomes dead simple.

## Installation

Progressive Web Apps for Rails works with Rails 5 onwards. You can add it to your `Gemfile` with:

```ruby
gem 'pwa'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install pwa

If you always want to be up to date fetch the latest from GitHub in your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'pwa', github: 'jonhue/pwa'
```

Lastly, go to your routes file (`config/routes.rb`) and mount the `Pwa::Engine` class:

```ruby
mount Pwa::Engine, at: '/pwa'
```

**Note:** The path `Pwa::Engine` gets mounted at, is currently required to be `pwa`.
