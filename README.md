# Progressive Web Apps for Rails

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/pwa.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/pwa) <img src="https://travis-ci.org/jonhue/pwa.svg?branch=master" />

This gem only provides the foundation you can build your Progressive Web App upon. It simplifies adding a service worker and a manifest to your app, so it can be recognized as an PWA and be accessed without a network connection.

[Google](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) defines Progressive Web Apps as:

* **Reliable** - Load instantly and never show the downasaur, even in uncertain network conditions.
    * This is handled by Progressive Web Apps for Rails.
* **Fast** - Respond quickly to user interactions with silky smooth animations and no janky scrolling.
    * There are two technologies helping you with performance: *Turbolinks* & *AMP*. When you are using Turbolinks, use [TurbolinksAnimate](https://github.com/jonhue/turbolinks-animate) to get XHR requests + smooth page transitions that add some delight to using to your app. If you want to use AMP, take a look at [amp-html](https://github.com/jonhue/amp-html), an Accelerated Mobile Pages library for Rails apps.
* **Engaging** - Feel like a natural app on the device, with an immersive user experience.
    * When you think about making your app more engaging, you can't get around user-notifications. OneSignal is a powerful (& free) solution. With [devise-onseignal](https://github.com/jonhue/devise-onesignal) and [notification-pusher-onesignal](https://github.com/jonhue/notifications-rails/tree/master/notification-pusher/notification-pusher-onesignal) adding native notification capabilities to your app becomes dead simple.

## Installation

Progressive Web Apps for Rails works with Rails 5 onwards. You can add it to your `Gemfile` with:

```ruby
gem 'pwa'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install pwa

If you always want to be up to date fetch the latest from GitHub in your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'pwa', github: 'jonhue/pwa'
```

Now run the generator:

    $ rails g pwa

Make sure to add the required javascript in `app/assets/javascripts/application.js`:

```js
//= require pwa
```

Lastly, go to your routes file (`config/routes.rb`) and mount the `Pwa::Engine` class:

```ruby
mount Pwa::Engine, at: '/pwa'
```

**Note:** The path `Pwa::Engine` gets mounted at, is currently required to be `pwa`.

---

## Usage

### Manifest

The generator generates a `manifest.json` file located in the `public` directory. You can customize it to your liking.

### Service worker

The generator also generates a service worker which caches visited pages to the local storage so they can get accessed even if the device has no network connection.

You can customize the page that shows up when a requested page has not been cached by editing the contents of `app/views/pwa/offline/index.html.erb`

**Note:** When using Progressive Web Apps for Rails with a service worker provided by a third party service like OneSignal, remove the require statement from `app/assets/javascripts/application.js` and manually import your apps service worker in the third party script:

```js
importScripts('https://example.com/pwa-sw.js');
```
